# Anti-Deportation Toolforge

**Radical tools for collective protection.**

The Anti-Deportation Toolforge is a living, open-source infrastructure project aimed at protecting undocumented people and resisting carceral immigration systems. We build, curate, and connect microtools, data structures, and knowledge frameworks that increase safety, agency, and coordination across borders.

This is not a symbolic project. It is for direct use.

## ✴️ Purpose

* Develop protective tools for undocumented individuals and their allies
* Coordinate tactical, educational, and infrastructural resources
* Make invisible systems visible—and vulnerable
* Center care, autonomy, and material solidarity over institutional dependence
